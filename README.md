*"If you want to be one year behind, don’t read bioRxiv”* – Jeff Leek

Welcome to the GitHub repository of PREreview 2.0, a planned rewrite of the current [PREreview.org](https://prereview.org) platform.

[PREreview.org](https://prereview.org) is a free online platfrom for the collaborative writing of preprint reviews. This project was born from the collaboration between Samantha Hindle and Daniela Saderi, neuroscientists and ASAPbio Ambassadors. [ASAPbio](http://asapbio.org/) (Accelerating Science And Publication in biology) is a non-profit organization dedicated to spreading the word about preprints to accelerate scientific discovery. Starting in May 2018, Monica Granados, also a scientist and open science advocate, joined our team.

Find more about our team and the project on the [PREreview Preprint Journal Club GitHub repository](https://github.com/SamanthaHindle/preprint_JournalClub).
